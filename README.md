Here’s an updated version of the `README.md` with the addition of upcoming features related to direct posting on LinkedIn and Medium through DeltaV:

# Blog Content Generator Agent

This agent is designed to generate blog content based on a given topic by utilizing the Google Gemini API for AI-powered content creation. The agent is built using Fetch.ai's `uagents` framework, allowing it to process requests and return generated content.

## Installation

Before using this code, ensure you have the following packages installed:

```bash
pip install google-generativeai uagents
```

## Configuration

To begin, you must configure the Google Gemini API by entering your API key in the `genai.configure` function.

Replace `"AIzaSyDxxSzqkL24eW3nSCjNyyM9CaydBtBqfTA"` with your actual API key.

```python
genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
```

## How It Works

### 1. Agent Initialization

The agent is created and initialized using Fetch.ai’s `uagents` library:

```python
agent = Agent()
```

### 2. Protocol Definition

A `Protocol` named `BlogRequestProtocol` is defined to specify how the agent will handle blog requests:

```python
blog_protocol = Protocol(name="BlogRequestProtocol")
```

### 3. Data Model for Blog Requests

A data model `BlogRequest` is defined using Fetch.ai's `Model` class, which contains a single field `blog_topic` for the blog content's topic.

```python
class BlogRequest(Model):
    blog_topic: str = Field(description="The topic of the blog content.")
```

### 4. Blog Content Generation Function

The `get_blog_content` function takes a blog topic, sends a request to the Google Gemini API to generate content, and returns the response.

```python
async def get_blog_content(blog_topic: str) -> dict:
    # Generate content using the specified blog topic
```

### 5. Message Handler

The `handle_blog_request` function listens for incoming blog requests, retrieves the blog topic, and calls the `get_blog_content` function. It logs the received request and processes the API response to either display the generated content or handle any errors encountered.

```python
@blog_protocol.on_message(model=BlogRequest, replies={UAgentResponse})
async def handle_blog_request(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: BlogRequest):
    # Handle the incoming blog request, log it, and fetch the blog content
```

### 6. Sending the Response

After generating or handling errors, the content (or error message) is sent back to the requester via `UAgentResponse`.

```python
await ctx.send(sender, UAgentResponse(message=message, type=UAgentResponseType.FINAL))
```

### 7. Protocol Inclusion and Agent Run

Finally, the protocol `blog_protocol` is included in the agent, and the agent starts running when the script is executed.

```python
agent.include(blog_protocol, publish_manifest=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent.run()
```

---

## Example Usage

To request blog content, send a message to the agent using the `BlogRequestProtocol` with the `blog_topic` field set to your desired topic. The agent will process the request and respond with generated content from the Google Gemini API.

---

## Error Handling

- If the Google Gemini API call fails, an error message is logged, and an error response is returned.
- Any unexpected errors are caught, logged, and reported back to the requester.

---

## Running the Agent

To start the agent, run the script:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

The agent will then listen for incoming requests for blog content generation and respond accordingly.

---

## Upcoming Features

### 1. Direct Posting to LinkedIn

In the future, the agent will be enhanced with the ability to directly post the generated blog content to LinkedIn. Using Fetch.ai’s `DeltaV` technology, users will be able to automate the posting of generated content, streamlining the process of sharing blog posts across their professional network.

### 2. Direct Posting to Medium

Additionally, the agent will support direct posting to Medium. This feature will allow users to seamlessly publish their generated blog content to Medium, expanding their reach and ensuring their content is automatically shared with their audience.

### 3. Integration with DeltaV

Both of the above features will leverage the power of Fetch.ai’s `DeltaV` platform to enable seamless automation and optimization of content sharing workflows. DeltaV will allow agents to communicate with LinkedIn and Medium APIs to ensure posts are made efficiently and effectively, reducing the manual effort required by users.
